    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <pre class="center">
        I am an 18-year-old and I am currently a high school student 
        studying problem solving with C++. 

        It has only been a year since I have started programming 
        but I only started problem solving few months ago. 

        I have experienced various cultures by traveling more than 15 countries, 
        but also I have lived in 4 different countries. 

        South Korea, the country that I was born in. 
        England, a country that I spent 2 and half? years during my elementary. 
        Brazil, a country that I first got to know about programming via 
        VEX Robotics and also lived for 4 years. 
        Canada, where I am currently studying, and I started studying 
        language C and C++ around the time I arrived here.

    <h1>Competitive Programming</h1>
    <br>

    <pre class="center">
        I started Competitive Programming in September 2021. 
        I first started from a recommendation that I got few months ago
        by the person who taught me C. So I started programming in C.
        While I was learning, I started to learn C++ together as
        there were more informations with C++.

        I first knew about Competitive Programming via tmwilliamlin168
        (William Lin), the person I respect the most in Competitive Programming.
        He gave me the first idea of Competitive Programming, which led me to
        start Competitive Programming. 

        My first competition was the Google Kickstart 2021 Round H.
        I was able to solve 2 out of the 4 problems, which was a massive
        success for me, and my goal is to solve more problems, and try 
        to be top 1000 global in the next Kickstart competition.
