    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <pre class="center">
        I am an 18-year-old and I am currently a high school student 
        studying problem solving with c++. 

        It has only been a year since I have started programming 
        but I only started problem solving 4 month ago. 

        I have experienced various cultures by traveling more than 15 countries, 
        but also I have lived in 4 different countries. 

        South Korea, the country that I was born in. 
        England, a country that I spent 2 and half? years during my elementary. 
        Brazil, a country that I first got to know about programming via 
        VEX Robotics and also lived for 4 years. 
        Canada, where I am currently studying and I started studying 
        language c and c++ around the time I arrived here.
